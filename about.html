  <h2>Marika Bach</h2>
  <p>
    For me, industrial design is an expression of revolutionising the world. 
    Design can empower, fascinate, bring joy, elevate or simply be a 
    beautiful object.

   <p></p> That's why I want to inspire people with my projects and 
    leave something great in our world.

      <h2>Early Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up, I always knew I had a talent for exploring and 
        creating new things. I was able 
        to prove this in sport and in school - as far as it was allowed.

      <h2>Formal Education</h2>
      <p>
        After graduating from high school with a focus on art, I was 
        accepted to the University of Applied Science's Bachelor's degree
         programme in Design. There I had the opportunity to learn the best 
         from the professors and students and to develop my skills in exciting projects in 
        the fields of sketching, transportation design and service design.

      <h2>Professional Growth</h2>
      <p>
        With the knowledge and experience I have gained in various teams,
         my strengths in team coordination and leadership have crystallised.
          This allows me to 
        look confidently towards self-employment and my own future company.
