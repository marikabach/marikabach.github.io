<p><h4>4.	Cookies / Tracking and Other Techniques Regarding the Use of our Website </h4></p>
<p>If permanent Cookies or other tracking techniques are used (text to be amended ac-cording to the specific case): </p>
<p>We typically use "cookies" and similar techniques on our websites [and apps], which allow for an identification of your browser or device. A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your computer and automatically saved by the web browser on your computer or mobile device, when you visit our website [or install our app]. If you revisit our website [or use our app], we may recognize you, even if we do not know your identity. Besides cookies that are only used during a session and deleted after your visit of the website ("session cookies"), we may use cookies in order to save user configurations and other information for a certain time period (e.g., two years) ("permanent cookies"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may con-figure your browser settings in a way that it rejects cookies, only saves tem for one session or deletes them prematurely. Most browsers are preset to accept cookies. We use perma-nent cookies [for the purpose of saving user configuration (e.g., language, automated log in),][in order to understand how you use our services and content,][and][to enable to show you customized offers and advertisement (which may also happen on websites of other companies; should your identity be known to us, such companies will not learn your identity from us; they will only know that the same user is visiting their website has previously visited a certain website)]. [Certain cookies are sent to you from us, others from business partners with which we collaborate.] If you block cookies, it is possible that certain functions (such as, e.g., language settings, shopping basket, ordering processes) are no longer available to you. </p>
<p>[In accordance with applicable law, we may include visible and invisible image files in our newsletters and other marketing e-mails. If such image files are retrieved from our servers, we can determine whether and when you have opened the e-mail, so that we can measure and better understand how you use our offers and customize them. You may disable this in your e-mail program, which will usually be a default setting.] By using our websites[, apps] and consenting to the receipt of newsletters and other mar-keting e-mails you agree to our use of such techniques. If you object, you must configure your browser or e-mail program accordingly[ or uninstall the app, should the respective set-ting not be available].]</p>
<p><b>If Google Analytics or other statistics providers are used, which do not transfer any personal data (such as e.g. e-mail addresses):</b></p>
<p>We may use Google Analytics or similar services on our website. These are services provid-ed by third parties, which may be located in any country worldwide (in the case of Google Analytics Google Ireland Ltd. (located in Ireland), Google Ireland relies on Google LLC (lo-cated in the United States) as its sub-processor (both «Google»), www.google.com) and which allow us to measure and evaluate the use of our website (on an anonymized basis). For this purpose, permanent cookies are used, which are set by the service provider. We have configured the service so that the IP addresses of visitors are truncated by Google in Europe before forwarding them to the United States and then cannot be traced back. We have turned off the «Data sharing» option and the «Signals» option. Although we can as-sume that the information we share with Google is not personal data for Google, it may be possible that Google may be able to draw conclusions about the identity of visitors based on the data collected, create personal profiles and link this data with the Google accounts of these individuals for its own purposes. If you have registered with the service provider, the service provider will also know your identity. In this case, the processing of your personal data by the service provider will be conducted in accordance with its data protection regula-tions. The service provider only provides us with data on the use of the respective website (but not any personal information of you). </p>
<p><b>In case social media plug-ins are used: </b></p>
<p>In addition, we use plug-ins from social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Pin-terest or Instagram on our websites. This is visible for you (typically based on the respective symbols). We have configured these elements to be disabled by default. If you activate them (by clicking on them), the operators of the respective social networks may record that you are on our website and where on our website you are exactly and may use this infor-mation for their own purposes. This processing of your personal data lays in the responsibil-ity of the respective operator and occurs according to its data protection regulations. We do not receive any information about you from the respective operator. </p>
<p><h4>5.	Datatransfer and Transfer of Data Abroad </h4></p>
<p>In the context of our business activities and in line with the purposes of the data processing set out in Section 3, we may transfer data to third parties, insofar as such a transfer is per-mitted and we deem it appropriate, in order for them to process data for us or, as the case may be, their own purposes. In particular, the following categories of recipients may be con-cerned:</p>
<p>
  <ul>-	our service providers (within the Marika Bach group or externally, such as e.g. banks, insurances), including processors (such as e.g. IT providers); </ul>
  <ul>-	dealers, suppliers, subcontractors and other business partners; </ul>
  <ul>- clients;</ul>
  <ul>-	domestic and foreign authorities or courts; </ul>
  <ul>-	the media; </ul>
  <ul>-	the public, including users of our websites and social media; </ul>
  <ul>-	competitors, industry organizations, associations, organizations and other bodies; </ul>
  <ul>-	acquirers or parties interested in the acquisition of business divisions, companies or other parts of the Marika Bach group; </ul>
  <ul>-	other parties in possible or pending legal proceedings; </ul>
  <ul>-	affiliates of the Marika Bach group; </ul>
</p>
<p>together Recipients. </p>
<p>Certain Recipients may be within Switzerland but they may be located in any country world-wide. In particular, you must anticipate your data to be transmitted to any country in which the Marika Bach -Group is represented by affiliates, branches or other offices ([LINK ON LIST]) as well as to other countries in Europe and the USA where our service providers are located (such as [Microsoft],[SAP],[Amazon],[Salesforce.com]). If a recipient is located in a country without adequate statutory data protection, we require the recipient to undertake to comply with data protection (for this purpose, we use the re-vised European Commission’s standard contractual clauses, which can be accessed here: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dec_impl/2021/914/oj?), unless the recipient is subject to a legally accepted set of rules to ensure data protection and unless we cannot rely on an exception. An exception may apply for example in case of legal proceedings abroad, but also in cases of overriding public interest or if the performance of a contract requires disclo-sure, if you have consented or if data has been made available generally by you and you have not objected against the processing.</p>
<p><h4>6.	Retention Periods for your Personal Data </h4></p>
<p>We process and retain your personal data as long as required for the performance of our contractual obligation and compliance with legal obligations or other purposes pursued with the processing, i.e. for the duration of the entire business relationship (from the initiation, during the performance of the contract until it is terminated) as well as beyond this duration in accordance with legal retention and documentation obligations. Personal data may be retained for the period during which claims can be asserted against our company or insofar as we are otherwise legally obliged to do so or if legitimate business interests require further retention (e.g., for evidence and documentation purposes). As soon as your personal data are no longer required for the above-mentioned purposes, they will be deleted or anony-mized, to the extent possible. In general, shorter retention periods of no more than twelve months apply for operational data (e.g., system logs).</p>
<p><h4>7.	Data Security</h4></p>
<p>We have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access and misuse such as [internal policies][, training][, IT and network security solutions][, access controls and restrictions][, encryption of data carri-ers and transmissions][, pseudonymisation][, inspections].</p>
<p><h4>8.	Obligation to Provide Personal Data To Us </h4></p>
<p>In the context of our business relationship you must provide us with any personal data that is necessary for the conclusion and performance of a business relationship and the perfor-mance of our contractual obligations (as a rule, there is no statutory requirement to provide us with data). Without this information, we will usually not be able to enter into or carry out a contract with you (or the entity or person you represent). In addition, the website cannot be used unless certain information is disclosed to enable data traffic (e.g. IP address). </p>
<p><h4>9.	Profiling [and Automated Individual Decision-Making] </h4></p>
<p>We may partially process your personal data automatically with the aim of evaluating certain personal aspects (profiling). In particular, profiling allows us to inform and advise you about products possibly relevant for you more accurately. For this purpose, we may use evaluation tools that enable us to communicate with you and advertise you as required, including mar-ket and opinion research.
  [In establishing and carrying out a business relationship, we generally do not use any fully automated individual decision-making (such as pursuant to article 22 GDPR). Should we use such procedures in certain cases, we will inform you separately on this and advise you of your relevant rights if required by law.]
  </p>
<p><h4>10.	Your Rights </h4></p>
<p>In accordance with and as far as provided by applicable law (as is the case where the GDPR is applicable), you have the right to access, rectification and erasure of your personal data, the right to restriction of processing or to object to our data processing, in particular for direct marketing purposes, for profiling carried out for direct marketing purposes and for other legitimate interests in processing in addition to right to receive certain per-sonal data for transfer to another controller (data portability). Please note, however, that we reserve the right to enforce statutory restrictions on our part, for example if we are obliged to retain or process certain data, have an overriding interest (insofar as we may invoke such interests) or need the data for asserting claims. If exercising certain rights will incur costs on you, we will notify you thereof in advance. We have already informed you of the possibility to withdraw consent in Section 3 above. Please further note that the exercise of these rights may be in conflict with your contractual obligations and this may result in conse-quences such as premature contract termination or involve costs. If this is the case, we will inform you in advance unless it has already been contractually agreed upon. 
  In general, exercising these rights requires that you are able to prove your identity (e.g., by a copy of identification documents where your identity is not evident otherwise or can be verified in another way). In order to assert these rights, please contact us at the addresses provided in Section 1 above. 
  </p>
  <p>In addition, every data subject has the right to enforce his/her rights in court or to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority. The competent data protection au-thority of Switzerland is the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (http://www.edoeb.admin.ch). </p>
<p><h4>11.	Amendments of this Data Protection Statement</h4></p>
<p>We may amend this Data Protection Statement at any time without prior notice. The current version published on our website shall apply. If the Data Protection Statement is part of an agreement with you, we will notify you by e-mail or other appropriate means in case of an amendment. </p>
